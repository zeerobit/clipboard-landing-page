## Overview

- This is the solution to the [3-column preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/clipboard-landing-page-5cc9bccd6c4c91111378ecb9). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


### The challenge

- Build it to look as close as possible to the design provided.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

-Started with mobile design first than use media queries for desktop layout. Built it in small chunks from top to bottom 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- Doing this challenge i learned how to color svg images using the filter property.Here is the code:

```css
 .social__media a:hover {
        filter: invert(53%) sepia(97%) saturate(334%) hue-rotate(122deg) brightness(96%) contrast(89%);
    }
```


### Continued development

I want to continue to improve my css skills by doing more challeneges on frontend mentor. I want to have a good grasp of flexbox first then start focusing on animation
